        This website hosts an enhanced video of the <b>Christchurch Massacre</b> along with the original stream, many people may ask, <b>"Why?!"</b>
        To explain why, I will first explain what the <b>Christchurch Massacre</b> was, along with my reasoning for wanting to
        (hopefully) permanently archive it to the public in both an AI upscaled look at what happened along with the original stream.
    </p>

    <p style="color: Red; text-align: center;">
        The <b>ChristChurch Massacre</b> which took place on the evening of <b>Friday March 15th, 2019</b> in <b>Christchurch, New Zealand</b> was where a white supremacist by the name of
        Brenton Tarrant geared up with MASSIVELY graffitied guns, equipment and over 7,000 rounds of ammunition he had all both legally and illegally obtained from local and online sources
        over the previous 2 years. With his arsenal was a FAST helmet, and a GoPro hooked up to his phone in his pocket which was streaming live on Facebook.
    </p>

    <p style="color: Red; text-align: center;">
        Something even more fucked is that Brenton had also hung a bluetooth speaker from his plate carrier, and had his 'white supremacist'
        playlist going at full volume during the Massacre, something that can be heard in the video.
    </p>

    <p style="color: Red; text-align: center;">
        Previously that afternoon, Brenton had sent a manifesto to over 50 people, including an Australian parliment member.
        She forwarded it to the Security, who forwarded it to the police who recieved it mere minutes before the shooting began.
    </p>

    <p style="color: Red; text-align: center;">
        After the stream had ended, Facebook sent out a notification to all of its users about what had just happened. I have a friend who tells me him and his High School buddies stayed up all night
        doing a makeshift teenage military operation to try and find the stream. They eventually did, but it wasn't until around 4-5 in the morning. They started looking around <i>midnight</i>...
    </p>

    <p style="color: Red; text-align: center;">
        ...and on that note, that's why I'm making this HTML site. After it happened, there has been a massive effort to suppress the original stream to ensure <b>NOBODY</b> can view it again.
    </p>

    <p style="color: Red; text-align: center;">
        I don't care what anyone says, that's <u>unacceptable</u>!

    <p style="color: Red; text-align: center;">
        Regardless as to what your personal feelings are on the matter, I understand being upset towards that <b>PoS</b> who did this, I myself am as well. But that is no reason to censor
        something that can be viewed by the general public and used as a training tool for people who might find themselves in such a situation, or for people who are merely curious and just want to see it
        because it's a valid part of history, being the first major mass shooting to be streamed publicly.
    </p>

    <p style="color: Red; text-align: center;">
        So for your viewing dis-pleasure, this is the NSFL stream that was, the <b>ChristChurch Massacre</b>.

        <b>Why did he do it?!</b>
        </h3>

    <p style="color: Red; text-align: center;">
        Brenton Tarrant was a white supremacist who lived in Australia, he spent most of his time on 4chan and 8chan ranting about political issues in his country.
    </p>

    <p style="color: Red; text-align: center;">
        He was upset about non-white immagrants coming into Australia and passionately advocated for non-white Europeans to be deported out of Australia. 
        He was also massively against Islamic culture, considering it 'violent and dangerous' (ironic).
        </p>

    <p style="color: Red; text-align: center;">
        The idea for the shooting likely came from him getting goated/influenced into doing it by users on 8chan, which probably festered with his personal beliefs and political ideologies.
        </p>

    <p style="color: Red; text-align: center;">
        He gathered information about mosques in New Zealand - studying floor plans, locations and further details - with the aim of targeting them at the time they would be busiest.
        </p>

    <p style="color: Red; text-align: center;">
        In the months before the attack, he travelled to Christchurch and flew a drone over his primary target, the Al Noor mosque.
        </p>

    <p style="color: Red; text-align: center;">
        He also planned to target the Ashburton Mosque in addition to the Al Noor mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre, but was detained while on his way to the third mosque.

        It's disturbingly amazing how much time, effort and dedication this man put into plotting out his attack on New Zealand 
        Mosque's, which is why it should be archived forever. I don't do this to glorify this man, I do this to continue further 
        efforts towards archiving content for the internet to view as they freely wish.
        </p>

    <p style="color: Red; text-align: center;">
        Don't let anyone tell you you're not allowed to see something because it's deemed 'offensive' or 'insensitive', give them a good ol' middle finger and send them a link to this website!
